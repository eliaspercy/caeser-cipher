# caeser-cipher
Here I made a variation of the traditional Caeser cipher initially using Haskell, and then translated it into a Python equivalent. 
This was partially done as an exercise to compare and contrast the two languages, particularly with respect to the extent at which Haskell can be syntactically imitated in Python.
